# whatsapp-supermarket-bot
A simple WhatsApp bot using only xpath pattern approach once WhatsApp obfuscate classes in each build. I used [whatsapp-assistant-bot](https://github.com/jctissier/whatsapp-assistant-bot) and [
Simple-Yet-Hackable-WhatsApp-api](https://github.com/VISWESWARAN1998/Simple-Yet-Hackable-WhatsApp-api) repositories as basis.

This bot was used to check products prices via WhatsApp so I maked a little portal to add products on db you can check this on "portal" folder but now it's can be maked using only the bot script.
